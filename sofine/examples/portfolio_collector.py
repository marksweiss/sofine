# TODO
# - write script to collect data from fidelity and ystockquote
# - save data into postgresql hstore k/v store
# - write code to perform useful queries with business rules
# - wrapper to update the data and report
# - cron somewhere

# TODO ADD TO README for this example
# install Posgress.app
# pip install psycopg2

# Before running Python script that imports psycopg2
# Do NOT do this in .bash_profile, as if affects any other process trying to link to
#  any other lib. So just precede call to run Py scripts using pscyopg2 with this
# export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.3/lib
